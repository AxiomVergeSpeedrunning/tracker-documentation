Item Object Structure
=====================

mName
-----

The name of the item, as used by the game internally. This is not necessarily the same as the name used ingame. For example, "Reverse Slicer" is referred to as "Scythe."

A complete list of these will be provided with the documentation at a later date.

For now, the `assets pack </assets.zip>` included with this documentation has icons for every item as ``{mName}.svg``
